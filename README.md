1. This app will have the amazing capability to toggle the categorization of each task. 
2. Depending on what is toggled it will increase the prioritization of each task. This will allow to each category to have a point system, that when added up will be able to shift to the top or the bottom. For Example:
3. work realated tasks will have a priority of 10 points, 
4. as which for the Personal task will only have 8 points. 
5. However the user will be able to set the prioritization point system on each category `making this app unique` for each user.
